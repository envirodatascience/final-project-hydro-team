**Comparative Analysis of Hydropower Projects: United States, India, and Global Context**

**Hydro Team | ENV 617 | Yale School of the Environment**

**Final Project â€” Spring 2025**

**Project Overview**

This project explores hydropower development across the United States, India, and the Global landscape.
Through detailed dataset comparisons, we investigate differences in design parameters, energy generation capacities, ownership structures, and temporal trends.
By combining diverse hydropower datasets, we aim to uncover patterns that can inform engineering, sustainability, and policy decisions.

**Research Questions**

**Comparative Analysis of Hydropower Designs**

How do physical attributes like dam height, crest elevation, and reservoir capacity differ across US, India, and Global projects?

**Correlation Between Design Features and Energy Generation**
Is there a relationship between reservoir size, dam height, and the electrical generation capacity?

**Temporal and Operational Trends**

How have hydropower designs evolved across decades in different regions?

**Influence of Administrative and Ownership Factors**

Does ownership type (government vs. private) influence capacity or operational outcomes?

**Geographic Scope and Installed Capacity**

How are hydropower installations distributed geographically? How much capacity do they represent in each region?

**Data Sources**

This project draws on three primary datasets.
- First, the United States Hydropower Data provides detailed information on dam dimensions, structural attributes, and project characteristics, offering an insight into U.S. hydropower infrastructure.
- Second, the India Hydropower Data from the International Hydropower Association (IHA) Database includes station details such as water head (both maximum and minimum), reservoir capacity, electrical generation capacity, administrative ownership, and project commissioning years.
- Third, the Global Power Plant Database, curated by the World Resources Institute (WRI), contains worldwide power plant data across fuel types; for this project, it was filtered to focus solely on hydropower projects, thereby allowing a broader international comparison.
